#When the litters are overturned by the whirlwind
#and faces are covered by cloaks,
#the new republic will be troubled by its people.
#At this time the reds and the whites will rule wrongly. 

#In the world there will be made a king
#who will have little peace and a short life.
#At this time the ship of the Papacy will be lost,
#governed to its greatest detriment. 

#The eye of Ravenna will be forsaken,
#when his wings will fail at his feet.
#The two of Bresse will have made a constitution
#for Turin and Vercelli, which the French will trample underfoot
